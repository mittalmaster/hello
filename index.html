		<h3 id="dish3">Poha</h3>
		<p>Poha is rice which is flattened into flat, light, dry flakes originating from the Indian subcontinent. Rice is parboiled before flattening so that it can be consumed with very little to no cooking. These flakes of rice swell when added to liquid, whether hot or cold, as they absorb water, milk or any other liquids. The thickness of the flakes varies between almost translucently thin to nearly four times thinner than a normal rice grain. It is also called "beaten rice",a Central-West Indian dish prepared using this flattened rice as the key ingredient.</p>
